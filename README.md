# horiseon-

## Description
 Feature Request Challenge 
 During this challenge a few things were accomplished to imporve the Horiseon Homepage. We have imporved the accebility of the page by adding alt attributes to each image. The order of the heading attributes, HTML elemnts and the structure on the CSS is more efficent and reads logially. I ahve also added a title element that compliments the page. This all should improve the score of the site and meets the accesibility standards. I imporved on the skills that were touched on in class this week; HTML structure, CSS layout and properties.  

## Installation

To visit the site use link, 
Once there you can open the ChromeDev Tools by right clicking on the page and selecting "inspect" to see the the HTML and CSS layouts.  

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
